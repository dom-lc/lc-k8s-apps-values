# K8S-Apps-Values

Repository that mocks the lc-k8s-apps-values.</br></br>
Here resides our values to apply for our charts that can be found in our [lc-k8s-apps repository](https://github.com/dom-lc/lc-k8s-apps).</br>

## Structure

We have a folder for every application, and in each forlder resides the values like values-<clustername>.yaml</br>
We could of created folders with cluster names at the root instead and in each cluster a sub-folder with each application name and then the values inside it.
